We start with a small review of vector-autoregressive models. Afterwards, regularization is discussed and the SparseTSCGM package is demonstrated.

## Introduction

Suppose we have four items called 'Positive Affect' ($x_1$), 'Anhedonia' ($x_2$), 'Irritability' ($x_3$) and 'Weightloss' ($x_4$). Measuring these items multiple times gives a time-series dataset where each observation consists of four elements. Written mathematically, the observation at time $t$ consists of four numbers $(x_{1t}, x_{2t}, x_{3t}, x_{4t})$. As a shorthand notation, people often write $X_t = (x_{1t}, x_{2t}, x_{3t}, x_{4t})$. $X_t$ is called a (four-dimensional) *vector*.

This is why it's called **vector**-autoregressive (VAR) modelling; we regress a vector $X_t$ on past `versions' of itself, instead of a single variable. The simplest VAR model only regresses $X_t$ on its previous measurement $X_{t-1}$. This VAR model is said to have a **lag** of 1. In formula form, this model looks as follows:

\begin{align}
x_{1t} &= a_{11} x_{1(t-1)}+a_{12}x_{2(t-1)}+a_{13}x_{3(t-1)}+a_{14}x_{4(t-1)}+\epsilon_{1t}\\
x_{2t} &= a_{21} x_{1(t-1)}+a_{22}x_{2(t-1)}+a_{23}x_{3(t-1)}+a_{24}x_{4(t-1)}+\epsilon_{2t}\\
x_{3t} &= a_{31} x_{1(t-1)}+a_{32}x_{2(t-1)}+a_{33}x_{3(t-1)}+a_{34}x_{4(t-1)}+\epsilon_{3t}\\
x_{4t} &= a_{41} x_{1(t-1)}+a_{42}x_{2(t-1)}+a_{43}x_{3(t-1)}+a_{44}x_{4(t-1)}+\epsilon_{4t}
\end{align}
